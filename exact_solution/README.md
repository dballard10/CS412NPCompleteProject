# CS412 Final Project: Minimum Color Graph
## Hunter Bowles and Dylan Ballard

To run this program, execute the `run_test_cases.sh` shell script.

This can be run by inputting the following commands in the command line:

* ensure that you have permissions to run the script with `chmod +x exact_solution/run_test_cases.sh`

* run the script with `./exact_solution/run_test_cases.sh`

Running these two commands should run the file and send the output to `output.txt`, found in the same folder as the `run_test_cases.sh` file

NOTE: make sure to run the shell script from the parent directory (`CS412NPCOMPLETEPROJECT`) to ensure proper execution

Test cases include 4 inputs: fast, medium, longer, and 20minPlus.

Tests will be run in ascending order based on approximate runtime

Each test case comes with an expected output provided in the folder expected_outputs, inside of test_cases
