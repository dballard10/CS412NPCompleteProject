# CS412 Final Project: Minimum Color Graph
## Hunter Bowles and Dylan Ballard

To run this program, execute the `run_test_cases.sh` shell script.

This can be run by inputting the following commands in the command line:

* ensure that you have permissions to run the script with `chmod +x exact_solution/run_test_cases.sh`

* run the script with `./exact_solution/run_test_cases.sh`

Running these two commands should run the file and send the output to `output.txt`, found in the same folder as the `run_test_cases.sh` file

NOTE: make sure to run the shell script from the parent directory (`CS412NPCOMPLETEPROJECT`) to ensure proper execution
